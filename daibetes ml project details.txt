Here's what each of these libraries is used for in machine learning (ML):

1. NumPy (numpy)
Used for numerical computing.
Provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions.
Helps in handling large datasets efficiently.
2. Pandas (pandas)
Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Provides data structures like DataFrames and Series.
Helps in reading, writing, and cleaning datasets.
3. Seaborn (seaborn)
Used for statistical data visualization.
Built on top of Matplotlib.
Provides visualizations like heatmaps, pair plots, and box plots for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4. Statsmodels (statsmodels.api)
Used for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
Helps in linear regression, time series analysis, and ANOVA.
5. Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot)
Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Helps in plotting graphs, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
6. Scikit-learn (sklearn)
This is a major library for machine learning, and the imported modules serve specific purposes:

Preprocessing
scale, StandardScaler: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
Model Selection
train_test_split: Splits datasets into training and testing sets.
GridSearchCV: Performs hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.
cross_val_score: Computes cross-validated performance scores.
KFold: Implements K-Fold cross-validation for model evaluation.
Metrics
confusion_matrix: Evaluates classification model performance.
accuracy_score: Computes accuracy of classification models.
mean_squared_error, r2_score: Used for regression model evaluation.
roc_auc_score, roc_curve: Measures performance of classification models using the ROC curve.
classification_report: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support metrics.
Machine Learning Models
LogisticRegression: Used for binary classification problems.
KNeighborsClassifier: Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
SVC: Support Vector Classification (SVM model).
MLPClassifier: Multi-layer Perceptron (Neural Network).
DecisionTreeClassifier: Decision tree algorithm for classification.
RandomForestClassifier: Ensemble learning model using multiple decision trees.
GradientBoostingClassifier: Boosting-based ensemble learning classifier.
7. Warnings (warnings)
Used to suppress warnings in the notebook to avoid unnecessary output.
8. Visualization Settings
sns.set(): Applies Seabornâ€™s default themes for plots.
plt.style.use("ggplot"): Uses the "ggplot" style for Matplotlib plots, improving aesthetics.
This setup is commonly used for data preprocessing, visualization, model building, evaluation, and tuning in ML projects. ðŸš€
